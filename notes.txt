Paging:

- Want a high memory kernel
    - Because: Then processes can have this mapped into their address space and lower addresses can still be used.
    - In order to do this, we need bootstrapping code, which does the following:
        - Sets up paging for itself and the kernel (kernel mapped to 0xc0000000)
        - Jumps to the kernel code.

    - Strategy here:
        - Compile boot.s and the paging trampoline to one executable with its own linker script.
        - Compile other kernel code to another executable with VMA 0xc0000000
        - Jump from one to the other :)

    How does loading multiple object files work with multiboot? Can we create an image from multiple object files?




Other option:
    Make bootstrap paging its own section and load it at a different VMA to the rest.

- Currently thinking of putting VMA 0xc0000000 and no LMA for kernel. I think this means that GRUB will load the kernel at phys 0xc0000000, so it probably won't work.
