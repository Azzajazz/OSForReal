# OSForReal

A hobby OS. I'm trying this for the third time, but skipping all the bootloader stuff since it's a pain.

## Building

Currently you will need to build your own i686-elf gcc cross compiler and build with that. I plan to make an automated toolchain install script, but for now I'm too lazy.
